Notes:
Since the Vector3D class was easy to write not much was put into design of the code and everything was straightforward.
The hardest part was setting up the environment. 
Since this is a new environment for some of our members learning how to use Eclipse, JUnit, and Git, in tandem was what we got the most out of this assignment.

Contributions:
Milad contributed by starting the assignment for the group adding the initial code, tests, and methods, then later refining some of that code.
Spending around 180 minutes in total on the assignment.

Kevin G contributed by getting our team's GitHub repo setup properly and adding a good portion of the methods and tests.
Spending about 180 minutes in total on the assignment. 

Kevin L contributed by adding the rest of the needed code to the repo and writing the overview.txt file. 
Spending around 120 minutes in total on the assignment.
